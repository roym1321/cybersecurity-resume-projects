The network is divided into **four floors**, The first one is the servers floor, and the rest are for three companies.

##### **Security Measures Implemented**
- **Port Security:** Limits devices per switch port.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Restricts unauthorized access.
- **VLAN Segmentation:** Reduces broadcast domains and enhances security.
